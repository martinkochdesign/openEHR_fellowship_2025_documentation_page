<h2>Project Context</h2>

<p>
  The project described here will be implemented within the clinical modelling methodology.
</p>

<p>
  Generally, this methodology consists of several steps. It begins with the identification of a need for a clinical model, based on a real clinical necessity. A multidisciplinary team conducts an <strong>analysis</strong> to determine all the necessary data elements. Consensus should be achieved by the team, drawing on professional experience and existing guidelines (such as the Minimum Data Set for Clinical Reports, for example).
</p>

<p>
  Once consensus is reached, the data structure is defined in the <strong>design</strong> phase. Here, the structure is specified, determining the occurrences and location of every element. This is guided not only by clinical necessity but also by technological frameworks. During the <strong>development</strong> phase, this structure is implemented into archetypes and templates using openEHR standards.
</p>

<p>
  When the templates are ready for publication, a <strong>validation</strong> process is conducted to ensure correct function from both clinical and technical perspectives. If validation is successful, the archetypes and templates are <strong>published</strong> in the international Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM).

<p>
  Although real-life development is not always as linear as the schema suggests, there is a critical moment: when the data elements for the data structure are defined, professionals must search for archetypes that might contain these data elements. This is important, as the philosophy of openEHR is based on the reuse of assets and worldwide consensus on reusable archetypes.

<p>
  At this stage, the professional must determine:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Which archetypes already exist that fit the data elements?</li>
    <li>Which existing archetypes need to be adapted (change request)?</li>
    <li>Which archetypes need to be created anew?</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The proposed project aims to assist professionals in this critical step, given the complexity of the archetype ecosystem.
