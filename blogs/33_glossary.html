  <h2>The openEHR Class Glossary</h2>
  
  <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
  <p>
    The openEHR specifications are complex and distributed across multiple webpages, making them difficult to navigate. For example, discovering all attributes of a class, including inherited ones, often requires switching between pages, which can quickly become confusing. Additionally, research into classes and their attributes is typically unidirectional. If a user wants to perform a reverse search—such as finding all classes that contain an element of class <code>PARTICIPATION</code>—this is essentially impossible with the current resources.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Existing Solutions</h3>
  <p>
    Tools like <a href="https://neoehr.com/openehr/uml" target="_blank">NeoEHR UML</a> improve the visibility and navigability of the specifications by providing UML diagrams. However, these tools still have limitations, particularly regarding advanced search capabilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    A text version of the reference model is available in the openEHR GitHub repository:
    <a href="https://github.com/openEHR/specifications-ITS-BMM/tree/master/components/RM/Release-1.1.0" target="_blank">
      openEHR/specifications-ITS-BMM
    </a>
    but it does not contain all the information required for comprehensive search and navigation.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
  <p>
    To address these issues, we generate a comprehensive reference model and store all relevant information in a JSON file. This format is easy to parse and enables a variety of search operations, including reverse lookups.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Implementation</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <strong>Data Extraction:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A Python script connects to the following openEHR specification webpages:
          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/BASE/latest/base_types.html" target="_blank">BASE Types</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/common.html" target="_blank">Common</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_structures.html" target="_blank">Data Structures</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/data_types.html" target="_blank">Data Types</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/demographic.html" target="_blank">Demographic</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/ehr_extract.html" target="_blank">EHR Extract</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/ehr.html" target="_blank">EHR</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/integration.html" target="_blank">Integration</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/RM/latest/support.html" target="_blank">Support</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The script extracts all tables from these pages. If a table represents a class, all relevant information is parsed and stored.
        </li>
        <li>
          The extraction process is automated to update the glossary dataset on a monthly basis.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Glossary Search Interface:</strong>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A dedicated HTML page was added to the Archetype Companion tool, enabling users to search the reference model data.
        </li>
        <li>
          Search capabilities include class name, attribute name, attribute description, and attribute data type.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
  
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Comprehensive, up-to-date JSON dataset of the openEHR reference model</li>
    <li>Automated monthly updates via Python scripting</li>
    <li>Advanced search functionality, including reverse lookups</li>
    <li>Seamless integration with the Archetype Companion for easy access</li>
  </ul>
