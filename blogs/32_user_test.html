<h2>Summary of Volunteer Responses: Archetype Companion User Testing</h2>

<p>
The first round of user testing for the Archetype Companion has attracted a diverse group of <strong>eight</strong> volunteers, representing a range of professional roles including clinical modellers, data modellers, medical information specialists, advisers, and interoperability coordinators. The cohort's experience with openEHR varies from newcomers with less than two years of experience to seasoned professionals with over six years in the field.
</p><p>
The projects proposed for testing reflect a broad spectrum of clinical and technical interests. Several participants are focused on developing or refining templates for specific clinical scenarios, such as patient admission, rounds, discharge, and adverse reactions. Others are interested in applying the Archetype Companion to national projects, risk factor assessments, and specialized therapies like instillation therapy for bladder cancer and intravitreal injection therapy. Some volunteers are exploring foundational use cases in areas like imaging, medication, transfusions, critical care, and alerts or notifications.
</p><p>
Overall, the cohort brings together both early-career and experienced professionals, ensuring a wide range of perspectives and use cases. Their collective input will provide valuable feedback on the Archetype Companion's usability and applicability across different clinical domains and project stages.

        Currently working on a project concerning instillation therapy for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer, but the project may have come too far for it to be a good testing candidate. Also starting a new project concerning intravitreal injection therapy, which may be a better candidate since it is starting from scratch.
