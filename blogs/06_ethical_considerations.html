<h2>Ethical Considerations</h2>

<h3>Questionnaire</h3>
<p>
  This project involves the use of voluntary and anonymous questionnaires to gather feedback from users. The purpose of the questionnaires is to inform the design, content, and functionality of the tools developed in this project.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Voluntary Participation:</strong> All participants engage on a completely voluntary basis, with the option to withdraw at any time.</li>
  <li><strong>Anonymity and Privacy:</strong> No personally identifiable information will be collected. Responses are anonymous and cannot be traced back to individual participants.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Usage:</strong> Data will be analyzed in aggregate form only and used exclusively for research and development within the scope of this project.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Web-Based Tool</h3>
<p>
  The web application developed as part of this project adheres to strong ethical principles regarding user privacy and data protection.
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No Personal Data Collection:</strong> The application does not collect, process, or store any personal data.</li>
  <li><strong>No Tracking Technologies:</strong> The website does not use cookies, analytics scripts, or third-party tracking services.</li>
  <li><strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> All information related to the use of the tool is stored locally in the user’s browser. This data remains entirely on the user’s device and is never transmitted to any server.</li>
  <li><strong>User Autonomy and Transparency:</strong> The design prioritizes user control, transparency, and minimal data exposure to ensure a secure and privacy-respecting experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  By implementing these safeguards, the project maintains a high standard of ethical responsibility and respects the rights and privacy of all users.
