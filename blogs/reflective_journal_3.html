It is surprising how quickly time seems to be passing, even though, on the surface, it does not always feel that way. Looking back, I realise how much progress has been made, and yet there is still much to do.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of November, I made the decision to initiate a user test with real users of the application. This marks a significant milestone in the project, as it moves from internal development and planning to actual engagement with the intended audience. According to my timeline, this testing phase will extend into the beginning of next year, allowing ample time for thorough feedback and analysis.
</p>

<p>
The planned timeline is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mon 10/11/2025</strong> - Mailing for volunteers</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 17/11/2025</strong> - Reminder</li>
  <li><strong>Fri 21/11/2025</strong> - Deadline for applications</li>
  <li><strong>Tue 25/11/2025</strong> - Publish user test page</li>
  <li><strong>Wed 26/11/2025</strong> - Contact accepted applicants</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 01/12/2025</strong> - Official start of testing</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 08/12/2025</strong> - Questionnaire accessible</li>
  <li><strong>Fri 19/12/2025</strong> - Deadline for test &amp; questionnaire</li>
  <li><strong>End of December-Start of January</strong> - ⛄Holidays!⛄</li>
  <li><strong>07/01/2026</strong>-Analysis of the feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am hopeful that the feedback collected during this period will provide valuable insights. Ideally, I would like to receive suggestions for future development, as well as identify minor improvements that can be implemented before the project is concluded. Engaging with real users is both exciting and a little daunting, as it will be the first real test of the application’s usability and effectiveness in a practical context.
</p>

<p>
Looking ahead, I am aware that the next few weeks will be busy, balancing the ongoing management of the user test with other project responsibilities. However, I am optimistic that this process will not only validate the work done so far but also highlight areas for refinement and innovation. Ultimately, I hope this phase will contribute to delivering a more robust and user-centred application.
