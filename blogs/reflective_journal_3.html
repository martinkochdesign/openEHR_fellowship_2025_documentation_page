<h3>Continuing Work on the Tutorials</h3>

<p>
I have made further progress on the user manual, which is now available <a href="../manual.html" target="_blank">here</a>. In addition, I have created a comprehensive set of video tutorials to support the upcoming user test scheduled for December 2025. These tutorials can be accessed <a href="../manual.html#video-tutorials" target="_blank">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
Working on the documentation has been a valuable exercise in distilling the essential information that users need. This process has enabled me to clarify the workflow within the Archetype Companion, ensuring that the steps are logical and easy to follow. By breaking down complex processes into clear, concise instructions, I have gained a deeper understanding of the user's perspective and the challenges they might face.
</p>

<p>
While scripting and recording the video tutorials, I encountered several UI/UX elements that were less intuitive than I had anticipated. This hands-on experience highlighted areas for improvement, and I took the opportunity to make immediate adjustments to the interface. These changes were aimed at enhancing usability and providing a smoother, more enjoyable user experience.
</p>

<p>
Overall, this phase of the project has reinforced the importance of iterative development and user-centred design. Creating both written and video documentation not only supports users but also serves as a valuable feedback loop for refining the application itself.

<h3>Presenting the Archetype Companion to the world</h3>

<p>
It is surprising how quickly time seems to be passing, even though, on the surface, it does not always feel that way. Looking back, I realise how much progress has been made, and yet there is still much to do.
</p>

<p>
At the beginning of November, I made the decision to initiate a user test with real users of the application. This marks a significant milestone in the project, as it moves from internal development and planning to actual engagement with the intended audience. According to my timeline, this testing phase will extend into the beginning of next year, allowing ample time for thorough feedback and analysis.
</p>

<p>
The planned timeline is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mon 10/11/2025</strong> - Mailing for volunteers</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 17/11/2025</strong> - Reminder</li>
  <li><strong>Fri 21/11/2025</strong> - Deadline for applications</li>
  <li><strong>Tue 25/11/2025</strong> - Publish user test page</li>
  <li><strong>Wed 26/11/2025</strong> - Contact accepted applicants</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 01/12/2025</strong> - Official start of testing</li>
  <li><strong>Mon 08/12/2025</strong> - Questionnaire accessible</li>
  <li><strong>Fri 19/12/2025</strong> - Deadline for test &amp; questionnaire</li>
  <li><strong>End of December-Start of January</strong> - ⛄Holidays!⛄</li>
  <li><strong>07/01/2026</strong>-Analysis of the feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>
I am hopeful that the feedback collected during this period will provide valuable insights. Ideally, I would like to receive suggestions for future development, as well as identify minor improvements that can be implemented before the project is concluded. Engaging with real users is both exciting and a little daunting, as it will be the first real test of the application's usability and effectiveness in a practical context.
</p>

<p>
Looking ahead, I am aware that the next few weeks will be busy, balancing the ongoing management of the user test with other project responsibilities. However, I am optimistic that this process will not only validate the work done so far but also highlight areas for refinement and innovation. Ultimately, I hope this phase will contribute to delivering a more robust and user-centred application.
</p>


<h3>First user test concluded! The results are in!</h3>

<p>
  By closing the user test in December, we can start the year with a clear view on the last month of the fellowship.
</p>

<p>
  In general, the feedback was positive for the application.
</p>

<p>
  Obviously, the application cannot be perfect, and the testing depended on the users clearly understanding the intended use of the application and any technical difficulties that lurk around every corner.
</p>

<p>
  It stings a little when you receive criticism for something that you have worked on for so long, but in this case everything was very constructive.
</p>

<p>
  The complete analysis of the feedback is documented here:
  <a href="index.html?blog=32_user_test.html">CLICK HERE!</a>
</p>

<p>
  It has to be seen how far the identified problems can be addressed in the next month to give a better experience to future users.
</p>

<p>
  Bigger, general changes to the intended use will have to be analysed, and the future development of the application has to be discussed further.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>To all testers:</strong> a heartfelt thank you for the time, care, and honesty you invested in trying out the Archetype Companion. Your detailed feedback and thoughtful criticism are not only deeply appreciated, but will directly shape how the application evolves from here.
</p>




<h3>Fellowship session Month 7 - The Standards Landscape</h3>

<p>
I'm very happy to have participated in the session for month 7. I found both presentations extremely informative and useful.
</p>

<p>
The presentation by John Meredith (EY) was especially interesting regarding the pitfalls of interoperability and the benefits of an open system approach. Although the talk was quite rapid-fire and some things went over my head, the main ideas were clear to me. One key takeaway is that semantics are really important - interoperability always comes at a cost, because every data transformation destroys a part of the semantic meaning. The further we are in the development process, the more expensive it becomes to change the data pipeline. It's clear that everyone has to conform and standardize, but standards alone aren't enough. We need open platforms to actually operationalize open standards, and that's where FHIR and openEHR come in. The aim is to have a semantically coherent, canonical foundation, where the open nature of the platform enables a shared modeling effort.
</p>

<p>
The presentation by Luis Marco Ruiz (vitagroup) was very practical, which I appreciated. He gave a detailed description of the data pathway, starting from patient consent on paper, moving to implementation in FHIR, including openEHR clinical data, and finally transmitting everything to a central repository for research. I found the discussion about the impact of German law on anonymization particularly interesting, as it showed how the legal framework dictates the technical solution-in this case, requiring double pseudonymization of the data.
</p>

<p>
Overall, I found both presentations valuable and thought-provoking.
</p>

<h3>Fellowship session Month 8 - Real World Cases</h3>

<p>
The Month 8 session with Luke Readman on One London showed me how hard it is to truly connect health and care systems, even within a single city. London is officially one region, but in practice it is a complex web of programmes, organisations and technologies that all need to work together. The London Care Record, the Universal Care Plan and the wider One London efforts illustrated how far reality is from the clean, integrated vision we often talk about.
</p>
<p>
The “Titanic strategy” warning really stayed with me: it is tempting to focus on the shiny, visible innovations above the surface while neglecting the large, invisible foundations underneath. Repeated reinvention and persistent inequities are, in a way, symptoms of this imbalance. For me, this connects directly to my openEHR work and clinical data repositories: advanced apps and analytics only make sense if they rest on a solid, resilient data and governance layer.
</p>
<p>
Leadership stood out as the key principle. Not as vague inspiration, but as the ability to define a clear shared strategy, insist on standards, keep equity in view, and resist being distracted by short-term wins. The One London Citizens' Summit also showed that leadership here includes engaging the public and building trust, not just managing technology.
</p>
<p>
This leads to a question I am still asking myself: how can we introduce innovation into such a complicated network without draining resources from building and maintaining the foundational infrastructure? In my own context, I feel a strong pull towards new tools and features, but this session reminded me that real progress depends on disciplined focus: investing first in interoperability, governance and robust data structures, and making sure that any innovation strengthens, rather than undermines, that base.
