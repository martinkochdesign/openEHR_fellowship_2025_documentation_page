<h2>ADL Extraction - GUI</h2>

<p>From the previous general description of the application, the GUI must fulfill the following functions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Provide the possibility to select between different data sources.</li>
    <li>Give control over the generation of the dataset.</li>
    <li>Provide feedback during the entire process.</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on these functionalities, a straightforward design can be drafted:</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="images/adl_extraction_wireframe.png" alt="ADL extraction - GUI wireframe" width="500">
    <br>
    <small>ADL extraction - GUI wireframe</small>
</div>

<p>The elements are as follows:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Title bar:</strong> System title bar with common functionalities: "close", "minimize", and "maximize".</li>
    <li><strong>Title label:</strong> A label indicating the name of the application.</li>
    <li>
        <strong>Source selection:</strong> Radio buttons that allow selection of one of the data sources. Planned options are:
        <ul>
            <li>International CKM</li>
            <li>CKM CatSalut</li>
            <li>Arketyper (Norwegian CKM)</li>
            <li>CKM Highmed</li>
            <li>GitHub of International CKM</li>
            <li>GitHub of CKM CatSalut</li>
            <li>GitHub of Arketyper</li>
            <li>GitHub of the former Apperta CKM (UK)</li>
            <li>Local ZIP file</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Select file path button:</strong> If "Local ZIP file" is selected, this button is enabled. When pressed, the standard file selection window will open.</li>
    <li><strong>File path textbox:</strong> After selecting the local ZIP file, the path is shown here. Alternatively, a file path can be pasted here.</li>
    <li><strong>Message box:</strong> Text box that serves as output. On startup, it shows version and copyright information. When the process starts, feedback is given at every stage.</li>
    <li><strong>Create dataset button:</strong> This button is enabled when a data source is selected. Once pressed, it executes the process of download, extraction, and transformation.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that no selection for the output file folder is planned by now. The output file is created and saved in the same directory as the application.</p>
<p>Also note that no custom GitHub or CKM URLs are planned. This might be added in future versions.</p>

<p>The final resulting GUI was implemented in python using the <i>import tkinter</i> and <i>
    customtkinter</i> libraries.</p>
