    <h3>Managing a Collection</h3>
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p><strong>What it is</strong> - 
      Collections are groups of archetypes that you wish to keep together for reference or reuse.
      A collection contains both "existing" archetypes from the archetype database and basic "new" archetypes that you can define yourself.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Where to find it</strong> - 
      The collection is located on the left-hand side of the main view interface.
    </p>

      <p>Add archetypes from the "existing archetypes" list to your collection.</p>
      <p>Select the desired archetype in the "existing archetypes" list by clicking on it. An icon will appear on the right-hand side of the list. Click the "Add to collection" icon, and the archetype will be moved from the "existing" list to the "collection" list.</p>

      <p>Apart from being part of the collection, the archetype is now available in the dropdown menus of the checklist editor.</p>
    
  
    <h4>Remove Existing Archetype</h4>
    
      <p>If you no longer wish to keep an "existing" archetype in your collection, you can move it back to the "existing archetypes" list.
      Click on the archetype in the collection list to select it.
      An icon will appear on the right of the collection list.</p>

    <h4>Create a "New" Archetype</h4>
    
      <p>If you need to plan a new archetype for your project, you can create a basic placeholder here. On the right side of the collection list, you will find the "Add new archetype" icon. Click on it to create a new archetype.</p>


      <div style="text-align: center;">

      <small>
      Create a "new" archetype for the collection list.
      </small>
    </div>  

      <p>The new archetype will be selected automatically. As shown in the information view, the archetype has no information associated with it.</p>
    
  
    <h4>Edit a "New" Archetype</h4>
    
      <p>Select the "new" archetype you wish to edit in your collection list. Note that the archetype data will be loaded into the archetype info window. There is also an edit icon. Click the edit icon to open the editor window.</p>

      </small>
    </div>  

      <p>Here, you can edit the concept name and the archetype ID. New archetypes are identified in the system by a unique UUID assigned during creation.</p>
      
      
      <div style="text-align: center;">

      </small>
    </div>  

      <p>Please note that this "new archetype" does not constitute a "real" openEHR archetype. It is simply a tool to indicate the need for a new archetype in the repository.</p>
    
  
    <h5>Include Archetype</h5>
    
      <p>If you plan to have a Cluster in the "new" archetype that is defined to include another existing archetype, you can add a list of inclusion statements.
        To do so, select the archetype you wish to include from the dropdown list. The selectable archetypes are provided in the selection list.</p>

          <small>
          Select an archetype to include from the dropdown list.

      <p>If you wish to delete an inclusion statement, select the archetype you want to remove from the dropdown menu and press the "Remove" button.</p>
