    <h3>Source Code</h3>
    <p>
      The complete source code for the ADL extraction component can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/martinkochdesign/openEHR_fellowship_2025_project/tree/main/src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <code>src</code> folder

      of the repository. Please note that the version number is included in the folder or file names (for example, <code>V4_11</code> stands for version 4.11).

    <h3>Executable Release</h3>
    <p>
      For users who prefer not to run the source code directly, a compiled executable version of the script is provided in the
      <a href="https://github.com/martinkochdesign/openEHR_fellowship_2025_project/tree/main/dist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        <code>dist</code> folder
      </a>.
      This executable is designed to work on any modern Windows computer, making it easy to get started without additional setup.
    </p>

    <h4>Handling large files in GitHub</h4>

    <p>Because the executable file is bigger than 100MB, the file cannot be oushed directly to the GitHub repository. For larger files, Git Large File Storage (or Git LFS) has to be employed.</p>

    <p>For this, the current version at the time (v3.7.0) from <a href="https://git-lfs.com/">Git LFS</a> was installed on the computer with the GitHub Desktop installation.</p>

    <p>In the <i>.gitattributes</i> file of the repository a line was added to manage the large .exe files</p>


<div style="background-color: rgb(255, 235, 227); padding: 16px; border-radius: 8px; max-width: 800px; overflow-x: auto;">
  <pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: break-word;"><code>
        # Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
        * text=auto
        # Manage large exe files eith Git LFS
        *.exe filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text
      </code>
    </pre>
</div>
