<h3>Navigate and Search for Archetypes</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  The main function of the application is browsing and searching openEHR archetypes. In addition to an easily accessible list of archetypes, this application provides a fast search engine for an openEHR archetype repository, allowing you to find archetypes relevant to your needs.
</p>

<h4>Navigating the Archetype List</h4>
<p>
  The information for archetypes extracted from a repository is presented as an alphabetised "Existing archetypes" list of archetype IDs on the left-hand side of the standard view. You can scroll through the list using the mouse wheel while hovering over it, or by using the scroll bar on the right-hand side.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  Clicking on an archetype in the list sets it as the selected archetype. As a result, the archetype's data is loaded into the information window, and the visualisation updates to the new archetype if you are in "Archetype" or "Similar" view mode. The active archetype is marked in salmon colour in the list.
</p>
<p>
  The selected archetype can be added to the collection view using the "Add to collection" button. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
  In the bottom right of the list, a number shows how many archetypes from the database are currently displayed. This number may vary depending on filters and how many archetypes have been added to the collection list.
</p>

<h4>The Search View</h4>
<p>
  <strong>How to Access:</strong> The dedicated archetype search can be accessed via the "Open search" button in the "Existing archetype" list or the "Search view" button at the bottom right of the main view. In the search view, you have the archetype list as in the "Existing archetypes" list, and you can select and transfer archetypes to the collection in the same way.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Add Filter:</strong> There are different filter options. First, all archetypes can be filtered by class by selecting the desired class in the dropdown menu. 
</p>

  Second, archetypes can be filtered by text: enter your search term in the search bar, and the filter will be applied automatically with every keystroke.

<p>
  You can select which attributes of the archetype to search (name or archetype ID, purpose, keywords, and/or items). Note that selecting all attributes may slow down the search. The number of relevant archetypes is shown beside the search bar.
</p>

</div>

<p>
  <strong>Delete Filter:</strong> Whenever a filter is applied to the "Existing archetypes" list, a "Delete filter" button appears beside the search bar. Clicking this button resets all filter settings. This button will also appear in the "Existing archetypes" list if a filter is active.

<h4>History</h4>
<p>
  <strong>What is it?</strong> When navigating through archetypes, it is easy to lose track of those you have visited. The history view allows you to browse through previously visited archetypes.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>How to Access:</strong> The "History" can be accessed via the "Visited archetype history" button in the upper right-hand corner of the standard view.
</p>


<div style="text-align: center;">
