    <p>
      The <strong>openEHR Fellowship 2025</strong> includes 10 fellows divided into three streams: <em>Leadership</em>, <em>Clinical Modelling</em>, and <em>General</em>.
    </p>

      This particular fellowship is part of the <em>Clinical Modelling</em> stream and is mentored by Heather Leslie.

      The detailed goals and expected results will be explained in the subsequent documentation. In a nutshell, the goal is to create a tool that will help clinical knowledge modellers identify existing archetypes that fulfill the needs of their prospective models, as well as identify the need for new archetypes or change requests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The program started with the kick-off meeting on <strong>29th of May 2025</strong> and will run for 12 months.
