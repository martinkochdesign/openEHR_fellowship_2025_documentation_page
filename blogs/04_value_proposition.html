<h2>Value Proposition</h2>

<p>With the context of the proposed project in mind, a value proposition has to be created before going on with the project.</p>

<p>
    This proposition is informed by the <a href="https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-value-proposition-canvas" target="_blank">Value Proposition Canvas</a> from Strategyzer. The Value Proposition Canvas is a practical tool that helps systematically understand and address the needs of stakeholders. It works by mapping out two key areas: the "Customer Profile" (which identifies stakeholder jobs, pains, and gains) and the "Value Map" (which outlines how a solution’s products and services relieve pains and create gains). By identifying stakeholders’ pain points and desired gains, the canvas enables target proposed solutions at the clinical knowledge modelers' needs.

<h3>The "Customer" side</h3>
<p>
    The resulting canvas identified the following important points.
</p>

<p>The Clinical Knowledge Modeler wants to <u>create a data model structure</u>, based on a list of needed data elements. For this the modeler has to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Search and identify "official" <u>existing archetypes</u> that include fitting data elements</li>
    <li>Identify possible <u>necessary changes</u> in existing archetypes to accomodate needed data elements</li>
    <li>Identify the need for <u>new archetypes</u> that include data elements that cannot be found or included in existing archetypes</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important gains for the modeler in determination of the data model structure are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Re-usability: By re-using existing archetypes, the   This leads also to a faster development.</li>
    <li>Interoperability: The use of existing archetypes result in a higher interooperability between different systems.</li>
    <li>Identify gaps: The model structure can reveal archetypes that have not been developed by now in the openEHR community.</li>
    <li>Quality: Ultimately this approach results in a better quality in healthcare, by using interenationally developed models.</li>
</ul>

<p>The most hindering factors for the modeler in this undertaking are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No alternative search engines: The search for archetypes is contained to the CKM by now. The modeler is limited to few or no alternative search engines.</li>
    <li>Search for related archetypes: Starting from an archetype, it is difficult to find related archetypes or to visualize the relation to other archetypes.</li>
    <li>Fragmented workflow: The workflow of creating a data structure contains various programs (Excel, XMind, etc.) which are not specific for openEHR and information has to be treated manually.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The "Value" side</h3>

<p>To add to the modelers' gains and to remedy and overcome pain points, special attention will given to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Provide an easy to use interface for the webpage (search, planning and visualization tool).</li>
    <li>No vendor lock-in for the input. The data analyzed can come from any ZIP file ource with ADL1.4 archetype files.</li>
    <li>One project oriented software that can manage a custom collection of arcehtypes, including the assignment of elements to archetypes in the collection.</li>
    <li>Visualization of the archetype dependencies (parent-child, inclusion, exclusion, etc.).</li>
    <li>Fast search experience thanks to the lighweight archetype database.</li>
    <li>Recommendation of related or similar archetypes, based on a semantic recommendation algorithm.</li>
    <li>No vendor lock-in for the output. All output files (project save files, archetype data file, etc.) are going to be created in a readable format (most likely JSON).</li>
</ul>

<p>The services that will be needed to respond to the modelers needs are the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Consultation of archetypes in the international CKM or any ZIP file source.</li>
    <li>Parsing of ADL1.4 archetype files for the needed information.</li>
    <li>Automatization of parsing for periodic update of archtype information.</li>
    <li>Online hosting of the webpage for searching, planning and visualization of archetypes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence the value proposition can be formulated as:</p>
<blockquote class="cool-blockquote">
    This project empowers clinical knowledge modelers to efficiently search, visualize, and plan with openEHR archetypes through an intuitive, vendor-neutral tool. By streamlining the workflow and enhancing discoverability, it accelerates model development, improves interoperability, and supports higher quality healthcare data models.
