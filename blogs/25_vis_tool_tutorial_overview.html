<h3>Overview</h3>

<h4>Welcome</h4>
<p>Welcome to the openEHR archetype companion! This application was developed in the course of the openEHR fellowship programme. This platform helps you search, plan, and visualise archetypes for your clinical modelling projects. Whether youâ€™re new or experienced, we hope that this application can help you to model more efficiently.</p>

<h4>What is this for?</h4>
<p>This tool is designed for clinical modellers and informaticians who need to find, organise, and manage openEHR archetypes. The aim is to streamline your workflow by providing a fast search for existing archetypes and visualising dependencies.</p>

<p><strong>Search archetypes</strong> - You can quickly find archetypes from a database, using filters and keywords.</p>

<p><strong>Visualise archetype dependencies</strong> - The visualisation features of the tool help you understand parent-child relationships, inclusions, exclusions, and similar archetypes at a glance. You can even get recommendations for similar or related archetypes.</p>

<p><strong>Plan archetypes and template projects</strong> - Using the collection feature, you can organise archetypes, pre-plan new archetypes, interconnect them, and assign them to previously defined data elements of your project.</p>

<h4>A brief overview of the interface</h4>

<p>
When opening the application the user is presented with a graphical interface.

<p>
Here you can see the section of the interface that provides fast access to essential functions. These quick-access buttons allow users to perform frequent actions, and access important tools without unnecessary steps.

<p>
On the bottom of the interface yoiu encounter the version information panel. It displays the current version of the Archetype Companion tool, as well as the source and extraction date of the archetype database in use.

<p>
Also, on the bottom you find the four predefined view configurations available in the Archetype Companion. These standard views are designed to support different aspects of the applciation (from left to right):
<ul>
  <li><strong>Standard view:</strong> The standard view that is ideal to browse and view information of archetypes.</li>
  <li><strong>Info view:</strong> This view hides the network visualization and maximizes the archetype information window.</li>
  <li><strong>Checklist editor view:</strong> This view opens the checklist editor panel to the right.</li>
  <li><strong>Search View:</strong> This view openes the search panel to the left.</li>
</ul>
Each view is tailored to a specific modeling or validation task, and users can switch between them as needed to streamline their workflow.
