<h2>Visualization Tool - Visualization Language</h2>
<p>For the visualization tool, a network representation of connections between different archetypes will be visualized. The views defined so far are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Archetype Connection:</strong> For a selected archetype, the relationships to other archetypes should be shown.
        <ul class="sub-list">
            <li>Parent</li>
            <li>Children</li>
            <li>Inclusion</li>
            <li>Exclusion</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Similar Archetypes:</strong> For a selected archetype, similar archetypes should be shown.</li>
    <li><strong>Collection:</strong> For the collection, all archetypes from the collection and their connections should be shown.</li>
    <li><strong>Project:</strong> For the project, the sections and elements of the checklist should be shown with the corresponding assigned archetypes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For these four views, a clear and intuitive visual representation has to be defined. In the following sections, a proposal for a representation of every view will be elaborated.</p>

<h3>Archetype Connection</h3>

<p>
    In the <strong>Archetype</strong> view, all relationships between the active archetype and other existing archetypes are visualized. Different types of connections are represented with distinct symbols and line styles for clarity:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Specialized archetypes</strong>: Archetypes that are specialized from the active one are shown with a small black disc, an arrow pointing toward the parent, and a solid black line.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Parent archetypes</strong>: Archetypes that are parents of the active one are indicated by a large black disc, an arrow pointing toward the parent, and a solid black line.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Included archetypes</strong>: Archetypes referenced in inclusion statements within the slots of the active archetype are marked with a green circle and a green dashed connection line.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Excluded archetypes</strong>: Archetypes referenced in exclusion statements within the slots of the active archetype are marked with a red circle and a red dashed connection line.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Similar Archetypes</h3>

<p>
    In the <strong>Similar</strong> view, a collection of archetypes that are similar or related to the active archetype is displayed. These similar archetypes are highlighted in a coral color for easy identification. Notably, there are no direct connections shown between the active archetype and the similar ones in this view.

</div>


<h3>Collection</h3>
<p>
    In the <strong>Collection</strong> view, the "My collection" list displays various archetypes and their relationships. These archetypes include both existing ones from the database and newly proposed archetypes. Relationships can be of the following types: inclusion, exclusion, and parent-child. The coding for these relationships is defined in the following legend:

</div>

<h3>Project</h3>
<p>
    A project is visualized using three columns, arranged from left to right: <strong>Checklist Sections</strong>, <strong>Checklist Elements</strong>, and <strong>Assigned Archetypes</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    Checklist elements are connected to their corresponding sections with a dashed line. When an archetype is assigned to an element, it is displayed in the third column and linked to the element with a dashed line as well.
</p>

<p>Color coding of the linked elements:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pink:</strong> Section name</li>
        <li><strong>Green:</strong> Element name</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow:</strong> Existing archetype</li>
        <li><strong>Blue:</strong> New archetype</li>
    </ul>
